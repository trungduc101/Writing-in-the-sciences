# Week 1 - Principle of effective writing

+ Recognize that writing is hard for everyone.
+ Recognize that writing is a skill that you learn through practice.
+ Practice removing clutter from writing.
+ Practice writing clearly and concisely.

### 1. What makes a good writing

What makes good writing?
- Good writing communicates an idea CLEARLY and EFFECTIVELY
	- Takes having something to say and clear thinking
- Good writing is elegant and stylish
	- Takes time, revision, and a good editor!

What makes a good writer?
- Having something to say.
- Logical thinking.
- A few simple, learnable rules of style

Step to becoming a better writer:
- Read, pay attention, and imitate.
- Write in a journal.
- Let go of "academic" writing habits (deprogramming step!)
- Talk about your research before trying to write about it.
- Write to engage your readers - try not to bore them!
- Stop waiting for "inspiration".
- Accept that writing is hard for everyone.
- Revise. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try.
- Learn how to cut ruthlessly. Never become too attached to your words.

### 2. Examples of what not to do
+ Always ask yourself:
	+ Is this sentence easy to understand?
	+ Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
	+ Is it written to inform or to obscure?
+ Verb moves the sentences along, whereas nouns slow them down.
	+ A classic hallmark of "academic writing": spunky verb become clunky nouns..  --> difficult to understand

### 3. Principles of effective writing

Example: *Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer.*

Why it is difficult to read?
- The use of nouns instead of verbs: (`Dysregulation`, `initiation`, `progression`, `expression`) => slow the reader down
- The use of vague words  (`physiologic`, `molecular species`): Not clear picture in your head. => Don't add anything
- The use of unnecessary jargon and acronyms  (`miR`, `gliomagenesis`) => slow the reading down unless they are standard terms that everybody is familiar with.
- The use of passive voice: `has been shown` => awkward, hard to read as this is not the way we talk.
- Distance between the subject `molecular species` and the main verb `may play`. The key is reader waiting to the verb, the reader doesn't know where you're going with the sentence.

***Revised***:  *Changes in microRNA expression play a role in cancer, including glioma. Therefore, events that disrupt microRNAs from binding to their target RNAs may also promote cancer.*


**Principle of effective writing**:
+ Cut **unnecessary** words and phrases; learn to part with your words!
	+ Be vigilant and ruthless
	- After investing much effort to put words on a page, we often find it hard to part with them
	- But fight their seductive pull: try the sentence without the extra words and see how it's better - conveys the same idea with **more power**.
+ Use the **active voice** rather than passive voice:  (subject + verb + object)
+ Write with verbs
	+ Use the **strong verbs**
	+ **Avoid turning verbs into nouns**
	+ **Don't bury** the main verb! 

## 4. Common clutters

1. Dead weight words and phrases
	- As it is well known
	- As it has been shown
	- It can be regarded that
	- It should be emphasized that
2. Empty words and phrases
	- Basic tenets of
	- methodologic
	- important
3. Long words or phrases that could be short

| long words                     | short words |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| *Have an effect on*            | *affect*    |
| *Due to the fact that*         | *because*   |
| *Give rise to*                 | *cause*     |
| *The result of*                | *due to*    |
| *Assuming that*                | *if*        |
| *Based on the assumption that* | *if*        |
| *A number of*                  | *many*      |
| *A majority of*                | *most*      |
| *In many instances*            | *often*     |
| *less frequently occurring*    | *rare*      |
| *All the three of the*         | *the three* |

4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
5. Repetitive words or phrases
	- studies/examples
	- illustrate/demonstrate
	- challenges/difficulties
	- successful solutions - solution already success
6. Adverbs
	- very, really, quite, basically, generally,... suitable for speaking  but weak for writing



## 5. Few more small tricks...

**Eliminate negatives**
- You can **always** turn negative words into the positive ones, you just have to be clever
- It's usually much clearer when using the positive construction

Example:

| Negative                                                         | Positive                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| *I am not crazy about the movie but for its aesthetic elements.* | *I only like the movie’s aesthetic elements.*     |
| *I will not go to the market unless I have to.*                  | *I will only go to the market if necessary.*      |
| *She did not want to perform the experiment incorrectly.*        | *She wanted to perform the experiment correctly.* |

| Negative                 | Positive    |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| *Not honest*               | *dishonest*   |
| *Not harmful*              | *safe*        |
| *Not important*            | *unimportant* |
| *Does not have*            | *lack*        |
| *Did not remember*         | *forgot*      |
| *Did not pay attention to* | *ignored*     |
| *Did not succeed*          | *failed*      |

We can avoid negative sentences and strengthen the writing in many ways ([here](https://wordvice.com/grammar-avoid-double-negatives/).) 


**Eliminate superfluous uses of "there are/there is"**
+ By get rid of these *"there are/there is/there was"*, we get a much more exciting verb, rather than the *"to be"* ones

| Before                                                                         | After                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.*                     | *We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.*                       |
| *There was a long line of bacteria on the plate.*                              | *Bacteria lined the plate.*                                      |
| *There are several mechanisms that could explain the findings*                 | *Several mechanisms could explain the findings*                  |
| *The data confirm that there is an association between vegetables and cancer.* | *The data confirm an association between vegetables and cancer.* |

**Omit needless prepositions**
  + Often prepositions like `that` and `on` are completely unnecessary, they are superfluous
  + Makes every words count, especially in the abstract
  + You might think you need them, but you actually don't

Example, "that" and "on" are often superfluous:
- The meeting happened on Monday --> The meeting happened Monday
- They agreed that it was true -->They agreed it was true


## 6. Practice cutting clutter:

| Question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Duc                                                                                                                                                         | Answer                                                                                           |

| *Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.*                                                                                                                                                         | *Clinical seizures occurred in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.*                                                                                    | *Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of newborns.*                                           |

| *Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically.*                                                                                                      | *Injuries to the brain and spinal cord is among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically.*                                     | *Injuries to the brain and spinal cord are among the most devastating and expensive.*            |

# Week 7 - Beyond the Research Manuscript

+ Understand how to write review articles.
+ Become familiar with the grant-writing process.
+ Understand how to write a strong letter of recommendation.
+ Understand how to write a strong personal essay.


## Review article

Goals:
- Synthesize and evaluate the recent primary literature on a topic
- Summarize the current state of knowledge on a topic
- Address controversies
- Provide a comprehensive list of citations

3 types:
- Non-systematic review
	- or called "narrative" review
	- may be not comprehensive
	- qualitative review
- Systematic reviews
	- attempts to find and summarize all relevant studies. May even include unpublished work
	- follows a rigorous search strategy using pre-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Searches multiple databases
	- evaluates the quality of each study using rigorous, pre-defined criteria (often quantitative)
- Meta-analysis
	- a systematic review that additionally uses statistical techniques to pool data from independent studies (sometimes including unpublished studies)

Tips for review articles
- start with a more board search, and then narrow it
- clearly define your thesis or theme
- invest time getting organized
- divide the review into sections with separate headings
- consider putting information in tables, figures, and/or sidebars
- write for a broad audience

Outline
- Abstract
- Introduction
	- clearly state the aim of the review
- the body
	- divide into section
	- summarize the literature, organized based on methodology or theme
	- analyze, interpret, critique, and synthesize studies
- conclusion and future direction
	- what recommendations can you make?
	- what gaps remain in the literature?
	- what future studies would help fill in these gaps?
- Literature review

Why submit a research proposal?
- Clarifies and deepens your thinking
- increases productivity and impact
- critical in all career paths
- securing funding is an accomplishment and has positive career benefits

Example: https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships

1. Start early and gather critical information
	- compile possible funding opportunities
		- gather critical information
			- instructions
			- funded and unfunded examples
	- Read the funding announcement
	- Identify the review criteria
		- applicant
		- mentor, co-mentor, collaborators
		- research training plan
		- training potential
		- institutional environment and commitment
	- Understand the review process
	- Learn about internal policies and processes
2. Create a Game Plan and Write Regularly
	- Create a task list
	- Write regularly
3. Find Your Research Niche
	- Deep awareness of your field – identify critical knowledge gaps
	- Broad familiarity with the wider scientific community
	- Relevant and appropriate for the mission of the Funding Opportunity Announcement
4. **Use Your Specific Aims Document as Your Roadmap**
	- Why the specific aims document important?
		- perfect for eliciting feedback
		- it is a roadmap
		- reviewers will read it
		- Example: "State concisely the *goals* of the proposed research and summarize the *expected outcome(s)*, including the *impact* that the results of the proposed research will exert on the research field(s) involved. List succinctly the *specific objectives* of the research proposed, e.g., to test a stated hypothesis, create a novel design, solve a specific problem, challenging an existing paradigm or clinical practice, address a critical barrier to progress in the field, or develop new technology". 
	- 4 keys questions:
		- Is the question important?
			- Attention grabbing first sentence
			- Bring reviewers up to speed
			- Frame the knowledge gap/need
		- what is the overall goal?
			- Big-picture goal
			- objective of this proposal
			- best bet / hypothesis
			- supportive preliminary data
		- what specifically will be done?
			- aims
			- working hypotheses
			- methods
		- what is the expected payoff?
			- return on investment
			- related to goals of the funding announcement

## Recommendation letter

Think to consider:
- it's ok to decline if you cannot write  strong letter
- take into account the competitiveness of the position or award
- never ask students to draft their own letters

The candidate should provide:
- CV or resume
- information about the position or award
- the deadline
- specific information about how to submit the letter

Formatting
- Format it like an old-fashioned letter (date, address of the committee, etc.)
- Use letterhead (or the election version of that)
- Avoid generic greetings such as "to whom it may concern." Rather, address it to a person (if known) or "XX admission committee" or "XX scholarship committee."

Introduction (first paragraph)
- "I am pleased/delighted/thrilled to recommend XX for YY". "It's a pleasure to recommend XX for YY"
- How do you know the candidate? How long have you known the candidate?
- 1-2 sentence overview
	- "She is one of the most brilliant and accomplished students that I have taught to date" (highest praise)
	- "I've found her to be a diligent student and researcher. I'm confident that she would be an asset to your research team." (typical praise)

Body of the letter
- use clear, concise, engaging language!
- the length of the letter matters!
- Address qualities relevant to the position/award, such as:
	- Quantitative skills
	- Communication skills
	- Ability to work with others
	- Initiative
	- Ability to prioritized tasks
	- Creativity
	- Attributes of a good citizen
- Give specific examples and stories "show, don't tell"
	- "I sent her requests for edits at 10 am in the morning, and she turned around the revision by 3 pm the same day."
- Quantify and compare
	- "She is among the top ten percent of MS I have taught at XX"
- Point out extenuating circumstances (if applicable)
- Bold/underline to add emphasis
- If possible, quote others
- Be cautious...
	- When a letter focuses more on the recommender, class, or project than on the candidate, this is a red frag
	- It is OK to highlight strengths from the student's CV, but don't simply repeat what's on the CV.

Concluding paragraph
- In summary...
	- "In sum, XX is a star in all aspects. If there's anything else I can do to support her application, please dont hesitate to contact me" (highest praise)
	- "I highly recomend XX for this position. If you have any further questions, I would be happy to expand further on my comments" (typical praise)

Language
- "Though not the top student in the class, he held his own among an extremely gifted and experienced group" vs
- "he was one of the best students in my class of 50" vs
- "he was the best student in my class of 50" vs
- "he is one of the best students I've had in my career at XX"

- "I have confidence in her ability" vs
- "I have no doubt that she will go on to do first-rate research"

- "She is the most enthusiastic student I've ever worked with." vs
- "She is one of the most talented students I've ever worked with."

Tips for recommendatees
- Approach potential letter writers at least several weeks in advance of the deadline

	- speak from the heart
	- reveal who you are
	-  strive for flair, not "blah"
- give specific examples and stores
	- "show, don't tell"
- don't read your CV line by line
	- highlight relevant experiences
- avoid big words you don't understand and avoid cliches
- show interest in/flatter your readers
	- do your homework
	- be specific about why the specific program/institution/awards appeals to you
- explain gaps and failures
	- don't ignore these in hopes that reviewers won't notice the issue!

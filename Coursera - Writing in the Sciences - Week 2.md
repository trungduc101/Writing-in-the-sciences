# Week 2 - Verbs

+ Distinguish between active and passive verbs.
+ Practice writing with strong, active verbs.
+ Fix sentences where the subject and predicate are too far apart.
+ Correct specific grammar mistakes.


## 1. Recognizing a passive verb
- Passive verb = a form of the verb "to be" + the past participle of the main verb
	- example: is, are, could be, should be, would be
- The main verb must be a transitive verb (that is, take an object)

## 2. Advantages of active voice

- Active voice is the natural way to talk and write
- Passive voice is a way to avoid claiming responsibility for action
+ To turn the passive voice back to active: 
	- Ask yourself => ***"WHO does what to whom?"***
	- Be direct, into the point

+ Advantages of the active voice:
	- Emphasizes the author **responsibility**
	- Improve **readability**
		- Example: "*A strong correlation was found between use of XX and YY*" --> better: "*We found a strong correlation...*" --> much better: "*use of XX strongly correlated with YY*"
	- **Reduces ambiguity**
		- Example: "*General dysfunction of the immune system at the leukocyte level is suggested by both animal and human studies*" -->"*Both animal and human studies suggest that diabetics have general ....*"

- Is it OK to use the passive voice?
	- Yes!! Just use it purposefully. For example, passive voice may be appropriate in the methods section where what was done is more important than who did it.

## 3. Personal pronouns ("We" or "I")
+ Avoiding personal pronouns does not make your science more objective
+ "We" or "I" => claim responsibility for the assertion in the text
+ The goal is to be more objective (with personal pronouns), not to appear more objective (without personal pronouns).

## 4. Practice active voice

## 5. Write with verbs


- **Use strong verbs**
	- verbs make sentences go!
		- Example: _Loud music came form speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena moved as the hungry crowd got to its feed._ 
		- --> _Loud music came form speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena moved as the hungry crowd got to its feed._
		- ==> make the sentence so vivid, draws the reader in, brings the sentence to life

	- Try to avoid the use of adverbs, **pick the right verb** that already has the adverb embedded in the verb.
		- Example: *The WHO **reports that approximately** two-thirds of the world's diabetics are found in developing countries, and **estimates** that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in next 25 years*
		- --> *The WHO **estimates** that two-thirds of the world's diabetics are found in developing countries, and **projects** that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in next 25 years*
		- => Stronger verbs. The verb ***"project"*** embraces the idea of future

	+ Use **_"to be"_** verbs **purposefully** and **sparingly**.
		- Highly oversused in scientific writing and they're boring
		- Can't avoid it, but they should not be the predominant verbs 
		- Try to substitute those "to be" verbs with something a little bit more exciting, a little bit stronger
		- Examples:
			- _He is a student who is intelligent and confident. He is always completing assignments on time._
				- --> *The intelligent, confident student always completes assignments on time.* 
			- _It was difficult to get out of bed at 6:00 a.m. each morning._
				- --> *The student faced the difficulty and got out of bed at 6:00 a.m. each morning.*
			- _Bill is going to start bringing all of his books to the group session for studying._
				- --> *Bill decided to bring all of his books to the group study session.*
			


- **Avoid turning verbs into nouns**

	- Make it more ambiguous, lack of action, slow the reader down
		- *During DNA damage, **recognition** of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in **recruitment** of Sin3/HDAC and **repression** of cell proliferation genes.*
			-  --> *During DNA damage, H3K4me2 **recruits** ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together **repress** cell proliferation genes.*

| Before                             | After                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| *Obtain estimates of*              | *estimate*               |
| *Has seen an expansion in*         | *has expanded*           |
| *Provides a methodologic emphasis* | *emphasizes methodology* |
| *Take an assessment of*            | *assess*                 |
| *Provide a review of*              | *review*                 |
| *Offer confirmation of*            | *confirm*                |
| *Make a decision*                  | *decide*                 |
| *Show a peak*                      | *peaks*                  |
| *Provide a description of*         | *describe*               |
|                                    |                          |

- **don't bury the main verb**
	- Keep the subject and main verb (predicate) close together at the start of the sentence.
	- Readers are waiting for the verb!
		- Example: *One study of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting found that one two-thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS-related problem in the prior 6 months had done so.*
		- --> *One study found that, of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting, only two-thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS-related problem in the prior 6 months had done so.*
		- *One study of XXX found that only YYY* --> *One study found that, of XXX, only YYY.*

## 7. Few grammar tips

- . `Data are` not `Data is`...
	 - The word `data` is plural
	 - Ex: These data show an unusual trend. The data are critical.
	 - Datum: singular form
 
 - `Affect` and `effect`
	 - `Affect`: is verb
	 - `Effect`: is noun
 
 - `Compared to` vs `compared with`
	 - `Compared to` = to point out *similarities* between different things
	 - `Compare with` (used more often in science) = to point out *differences* between similar things
	 - Examples:
		 - *Shall I compare thee **to** a summer's day?*
		 - *Brain tumors are relatively rare compared **with** more common cancers, such as those of the lung, breast, and prostate.*

- `That` vs `which`
	 - `That` is restrictive (define) pronoun
	 - `Which` is nonrestrictive (non-defining) pronoun
	 - Key question: Is your clause essential or non-essential?
		 - THAT: the essential clause cannot be eliminated without changing the meaning of the sentence
		 - WHICH: The non-essential clause can be eliminated without altering the basis meaning of the sentence (and must be set off by commas).
		 - Examples
			 - *The bike that is broken is in the garage.* --> identify which bike of many
			 - *The bike, which is broken, is in the garage* --> add a fact about the only bike in question
			 - *The vial that contained her RNA was lost.* --> The RNA is essential => Identifies which vial of many.
			 - *The vial, which contained her RNA, was lost.* ---> The RNA is not essential. There is only one vial.
 
 - Singular antecedents...
	- Do not use `they` or `their` when the subject is singular. 
	- To avoid gender choice, turn to a plural!
	- Example
		- *each student worries about their grades* --> *all students worry about their grades*

- Other
	+ Be careful with "hedge" words (`no appreciable change`, `it is suppected that`,...). They often unnecessary and raise all sorts of questions.

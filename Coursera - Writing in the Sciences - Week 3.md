# Week 3 - Sentence and Paragraph

+ Practice using colons, dashes, parentheses, and semi-colons.
+ Recognize the importance of varying sentence structure.
+ Practice writing focused, organized paragraphs.
+ Recognize that it is OK to repeat key words in scientific writing.
+ Fix sentence parallelism.

## I. Sentence
### 1. Punctuation


Example:
Original: *Many types of cells and tissues develop a kind of directionality. Certain events happen toward one end of the cell or tissue or the other. It's a phenomenon called cell polarity.*

Using a colon: *Many types of cells and tissues develop a kind of directionality, called cell polarity: certain events happen toward one end of the cell or tissue or the other*

- Increasing power to separate:
	- Comma   `,`
	- Colon      `:`
	- Dash       `—`
	- Parentheses `()`
	- Semicolon `;`
	- Period    `.`
- Increasing formality:
	- Dash: `—`
	- Parentheses `()`
	- The others (comma, colon, semicolon, period)

 For more guidance and examples of using punctuation, read [**here**](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/)
 
**Semicolon** `;`
	- Connects two INDEPENDENT clauses
		- Example: 
		- *Kennedy could be a cold and vain main, and he led a life of privilege. But he knew something about the world; he also cared about it.*
		- *It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.*
	- (Note: a clause always contains a subject and predicate; an independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.)
	- Separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation
		- Example: *It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-looking policies; because people's perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too.*




**Parentheses** `()`
- Parenthesis (parenthetical expression):
- Use parentheses to insert an afterthought or explanation (a word, phrase, or sentence) into a passage that is grammatically complete without it.  *=> This is also an example.*
	- If you remove the material within the parentheses, the main point of the sentence should not change.
	- Parentheses give the reader permission to skip over the material.
	- Example:
		- *They also have a specialized tail, kind of like a monkey's tail, that allows them to cling to a piece of grass (or a lucky diver's finger).*



**Colon** `:`
- Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification.
- The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate the semicolon, and more formality than the dash.
- Example: 
	- colon (list or explanation): *The hydrogen bonds are made as follows: XX; XX*
	- colon (explanation or amplification): *That's one reason why I'm so optimistic about the future: the constant churn of scientific progress.*
	- colon (quote, list of quotes)
- colon (to amplify or extend)
- use a colon to join two independent clauses if the second amplifies or extend the first.
	- Example: *Companies use Marsh for the same reason that home sellers use real-estate agents: The agent's knowledge and experience is supposes to help the client get the right deal at the right price.*


+ [**The rule of three**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)): 
	+ Things happen in threes
	+ THREE is the pleasing number to introduce a list/examples
		+ Enough to make a point, but not so much to overwhelm the reader
		+ You don't always have to use three, but when in doubt, three examples is the default
	+ Examples:
		+ *"Veni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I conquered)."* - Julius Caesar
		+ *"Government of the people, by the people, for the people."* - Abram Lincoln (Gettysburg Address)
		+ *"We can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground."* - Abraham Lincoln (Gettysburg Address)
		+ *"Never in the history of human endeavor has so much been owed by so many to so few."* - Winston Churchil (Wartime Speech)
		+ *"Three things your spouse wants you to do in the event of an argument—take a breath, take a hint, and take a hike."* — Joslyn Chase



**Dash**  `—`
- Use the dash to add emphasis or to insert an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence. Just don't overuse it, or it loses its impact.
	- Example:
		- *But my fellow Americans, whatever mix of motives led us to create an Electoral College majority for Donald Trump to become president — and overlook his lack of preparation, his record of indecent personal behavior, his madcap midnight tweeting, his casual lying about issues like “millions” of people casting illegal votes in this election, the purveying of fake news by his national security adviser, his readiness to appoint climate change deniers without even getting a single briefing from the world’s greatest climate scientists in the government he’ll soon lead and his cavalier dismissal of the C.I.A.’s conclusions about Russian hacking of our election — have no doubt about one thing: We as a country have just done something incredibly reckless.*
			- Illustrates **the power of the dash**: Dump so much right into the middle of the sentences, and it still works and reads smoothly ***=> Emphasis the main point.***
			- The colon at the end puts emphasis on the last idea
			- The main verb is far from the subject. But it's still okay. We can easily find it right after the dash

		- *The drugs did more than prevent new fat accumulation. They also triggered overweight mice to shed significant amounts of fat — up to haft their body weight.* 
			- Use dash: emphasis.
			- Use comma instead: loss emphasis, more clunky.
			- Use parentheses instead: buries the information.

		- *Researchers who study shipworms say these mislabeled animals — they're clams, not worms — are actually a scientific treasure.* 
			- Use dash: emphasis and add information.
			- Use commas instead: not strong enough to set off a clause.
			- Use parentheses instead: buries the information.

- **Note**: You can violate the *"burry the main verb"* if you use dash. You can find the verb right after the punctuation.

| *Evidence-based medicine teaches clinicians the practical application of clinical epidemiology, as needed to address specific problems of specific patients.

### 3. Parallelism 
- Pairs of ideas joined by `and`, `or`, or `but` should be written in parallel form
	- Ex. "The velocity *decreased by 50%* but the pressure *decreased by only 10%*".
	- SVX but SVX
	- Ex: "we aimed to *increase the resolution* and *to improve picture quality*"
- Infinitive phrase and infinitive phrase

+ Lists of ideas should be written in parallel form
	- Ex:
		- *Locusts denuded fields in Utah, torrents washed away rural Iowa, and blazing heat shriveled Arizona's cotton.*
		- *She enjoys running by the lake, playing with her dog, and hiking tall mountains.*

+ How to create parallelism: Make a choice (grammar structure) and stick to it!
	- Ex: *NASA's intrepid Mars rover, Curiosity, has been through a lot in the past year. It flew 354 million miles, blasted through the Mars atmosphere, deployed a supersonic parachute, unfurled a giant sky crane, and touched down gently on the surface of Mars.* => starts with a verb, uses past tense, and deploys nice verbs.

+ Other examples:
	- *If you want to be a good doctor, you must study hard, critically think about the medical literature, and you should be a good listener.*
		- *If you want to be a good doctor, you must study hard, listen well, and think critically about medical literature.* 
		  => parallel with verb
	    - *If you want to be a good doctor, you must be a good student, a good listener, and a critical thinker about the medical.* => parallel with noun

	- *This research follows four distinct phases: (1) establishing measurement instruments, (2) pattern measurement, (3) developing interventions, and (4) the dissemination of successful interventions to other settings and institutions.*
		- --> *This research follows four distinct phases: (1) establishing measurement instruments, (2) measuring pattern, (3) developing interventions, and (4) disseminating successful interventions to other settings and institutions.*

	- *Bates describes the five principles for the success of decision support systems in clinical settings: speed, real-time delivery, integration into workflow, simplicity and to avoid data entry.*

## II. Paragraph 

### 4. Paragraph-level tips

- 1 paragraph = 1 idea
- Paragraph should be short => more focus, provide a lot of white space on the page (less tedious)
- Give away the punch line early
- Paragraph flow is helped by:
	- logical flow of ideas
		- Sequential in time
		- General --> specific (take-home message first!)
		- Logical arguments (if a then b; a; therefore b)
	- parallel sentence structures
	- Don't rely on transition words. Only use it when necessary.
	- if necessary, transition words: just use `but` and `and`
- Your reader remembers the *first* and *last* sentence best. Make the last sentence memorable. Emphasis at the end!



+ Exemplary example:
	
	*This kind of progress hasn’t happened on its own. It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-looking policies; because people’s perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too. **BUT this progress also happened because we scienced the heck out of our challenges. Science is how we were able to combat acid rain and the AIDS epidemic.** Technology is what allowed us to communicate across oceans and empathize with one another when a wall came down in Berlin or a TV personality came out. Without Norman Borlaug’s wheat, we could not feed the world’s hungry. Without Grace Hopper’s code, we might still be analyzing data with pencil and paper.* - Obama

- Analyze the paragraph:
	+ Only use 1 transition word - `But`
	+ The main idea is the third sentence => *Placed right in the middle*
	+ Paragraph flow: *General to Specific*
	+ Parallel structures:
		+ >Science is how we were able to combat acid rain and the AIDS epidemic.  
		  > Technology is what allowed us to communicate across oceans and empathize with one another when a wall came down in Berlin or a TV personality came out.
		+ > Without Norman Borlaug’s wheat, we could not feed the world’s hungry.  
		  > Without Grace Hopper’s code, we might still be analyzing data with pencil and paper."		
	  => **poetic, move the paragraph along.**


### 5. Paragraph editing

+ ***Original paragraph***:
	> "Most scents remain constant in their quality over orders of magnitude of concentration (12). Nevertheless, at high concentrations, quality tends to be negatively correlated with intensity, as was the case, for example, for the cinnamon oil used in this study. Hence, reliability of absolute scorings was achieved by calibrating the amount of perfume ingredients with initial ratings for intensity against a reference substance of known concentration. The final concentrations were in principal chosen in a way such that individual ratings showed variance among participants within the sliding scale between 0 and 10 (meaning that people could decide whether they liked a scent or not). This procedure seemed successful for most scents; however, the concentrations for bergamot (highest average ratings) and vetiver (lowest average rating) could probably been reduced even more, as both scents did not show any discriminating power at the level of common alleles (people agreed largely on the quality of these two scents) (see Table 2). Interestingly, the pooled rare alleles showed discriminating power for..."  
	>*212 words*

+ ***Outline***:
	- *Main idea*: Were the perfume concentration in the experiment appropriate.
	- *Point 1*: If the concentration is too high, the smell may be too overpowering and affect quality rating => not a problem because we standardized intensity
	- *Point 2*: The concentration is appropriate if they produce sufficient variability in quality rating. => true for most scents with 2 exceptions.

+ ***Edited paragraph***:
	> Perfume intensity and quality are negatively correlated at high concentrations: If the scent is too strong, people will rate it unfavorably. Hence, we chose the final concentration of each perfume ingredient so that it had similar intensity to a reference scent (1-butanol). The resulting concentrations appeared appropriate for most scents, as participants' preferences varied along the sliding scale between 0 and 10. However, participants largely agreed on bergamot (highest average ratings) and vetiver (lowest average ratings), so lower or higher concentrations may have been needed for these scents.  
	>*91 words*


+ ***Original paragraph***:
	> "The concept of chocolate having potential therapeutic benefits for people with diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus, presents a number of intellectual challenges, from both clinical and sociological perspectives. It seems almost counterintuitive to suggest an energy-dense food that is high in sugar, and often seen as a treat or a “dietary sin”, could offer such promise. However, a large volume of mechanistic and animal model studies has been undertaken demonstrating the potential benefits of cocoa and chocolate for both glucose regulation and modification of complications associated with diabetes. Cesar Fraga in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition first proposed the potential of chocolate for people with diabetes in 2005. It was suggested that we should consume more cocoa and chocolate to reduce the burdens of hypertension and diabetes.(1) Grassi and colleagues (2) further reinforced this potential for its antihypertensive and insulin-sensitizing effect with the mechanistic data. However, the hypothesis of chocolate having a beneficial effect remains counterintuitive to the average consumer and has yet to gain support among the wider medical and healthcare community."

	> Many mechanistic and animal studies suggest health benefits for cocoa and chocolate, particularly for patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These studies suggest that cocoa and chocolate can lower blood pressure, improve glucose regulation, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce complications from diabetes. But the idea of chocolate as medicine has yet to gain widespread support among consumers or among the wider medical and healthcare community. It seems counterintuitive that a high-sugar, energy-dense food — one often seen as a treat or "dietary sin" — could promote health.

### 6. A few more tips:

+ **Transition words**:
	+ Transition words aren't strong enough to fix underlying logic that's not sound
	+ Professional writer **only** use `AND/OR` (for tacking on additional information) and `BUT/HOWEVER` (for changing gear)
+ **Paragraph**:
	+ Paragraphs can flow beautifully without relying on transition words
	+ Parallel structure helps make paragraph flows
	+ Editing paragraph: the outline is needed to think through the logic carefully in head
+ Sometimes, use synonym leads the reader to think you are referring to a different instrument, model, group, variable

+ **Repetition**:
	- Before reaching thesaurus to avoid using a word twice within a sentence/paragraph, ask:
		- (1) Is the second instance of the word even **necessary**?
		- (2) If the word is needed, is a synonym **really better** than just repeating the word?
			- Challenges / difficulties
			- Illustrate / demonstrate
	- However, it's OK to repeat a word! (Sometimes it better than using an awkward synonym)
+ **Keyword**:
	 - Keywords need to be repeated **(Essential)**: E.g. names of comparison, groups, variables, or instruments
+ **Acronyms / Initialisms**:
	- Don't abbreviate words just because they recur frequently
	- Only use standard, well-known acronyms (like DNA)

| *Neuropeptides are important mediators in the functionality of the brain and other neurological organs. Because neuropeptides exist in a wide range of concentrations, appropriate characterization methods are needed to provide dynamic, chemical, and spatial information. Mass spectrometry and compatible tools have been a popular choice in analyzing neuropeptides. There have been several advances and challenges, both of which are the focus of this review. Discussions range from sample collection to bioinformatic tools, although avenues such as quantitation and imaging are included. Further development of the presented methods for neuropeptidomic mass spectrometric analysis is inevitable, which will lead to a further understanding of the complex interplay of neuropeptides and other signaling molecules in the nervous system.* | *Main idea "introduce tools in analyzing neuropeptides"*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | *This review discusses the advantages and challenges of using mass spectrometry for analyzing neuropeptides, important signaling molecules in the nervous system.*                                                                                                                                                                            |

| *Prior to calculating suicide rates that are stratified by church membership and activity level, records from the state and from the church needed to be linked.
